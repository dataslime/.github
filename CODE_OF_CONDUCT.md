# Contributor Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing community members with an open, free, equal, and respectful community environment, and ensuring that all participants can enjoy an undisturbed and inclusive experience. We encourage participants to show their professionalism on the premise of mutual understanding and respect, and provide assistance within their ability to the community and other participants.

This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members. Exhibitors, speakers, sponsors, staff and all other attendees at events organized by DataSlime (meetups, user groups) or held at DataSlime facilities are subject to these Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct.

Diversity and inclusion make the DataSlime community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.

Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly DataSlime community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other protected categories under applicable law.
